== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will Nexter Builder Work With All Themes? =
Nexter Builder is designed to work best with the Nexter WordPress Theme. However, its Code Snippets feature is compatible with all WordPress themes, so you can use that functionality regardless of the theme you're using.

= How Does Nexter Builder Impact Website Performance? =
Nexter Builder is designed with performance in mind, utilizing pure Vanilla JS without jQuery dependencies and smart optimized CSS and JS loading to ensure minimal impact on your site's speed. 

= Is Nexter Builder Compatible With Other Page Builders? =
Yes, Nexter Builder is compatible with major page builders like Elementor and Gutenberg, allowing you to create custom templates seamlessly. 

= Why Is This Plugin Offered Separately from the Nexter Theme? =

To adhere to WordPress's theme submission guidelines, we provide certain functionalities as a separate plugin. These guidelines specify that features like custom post types and other advanced functionalities fall within the “plugin territory” and should not be included within themes. By offering these features through the Nexter Extensions plugin, we ensure compliance with these standards while delivering a high-quality, feature-rich experience for our users.

For those interested in the specifics, WordPress considers functions like `register_post_type()` to be within the plugin domain. This approach maintains a clear separation between a theme's presentation layer and additional functionalities, promoting better modularity and user choice. You can read more about this in the [WordPress Developer Resources](
https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/). 


= How can I report security bugs? =
You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team helps validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](
